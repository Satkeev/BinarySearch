### Binary Search

Challenge  
Write a method called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any 
of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrays element that is equal to the search
key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency  

The iterative approach to binary search comes with a logn time because the array is continually being divided in half   
after every comparison. Since no other space is being analyzed or used, it stays at O(1).
